# 🚀 DSA Journey Tracker  

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** progress repository!  
This repo is my personal log of solving problems, practicing patterns, and tracking growth while preparing for product-based company interviews.  

---

## 📌 Goals
- Solve **500+ problems** across multiple platforms (LeetCode, GFG, etc.)
- Master **DSA patterns** (Sliding Window, DP, Greedy, Graphs, etc.)
- Build consistency: **3 problems/day** for 4 months
- Document approaches, mistakes, and optimizations

## 🌟 Motivation  

> “DSA is not about solving 1000 random problems. It’s about recognizing patterns, improving problem-solving speed, and developing confidence.”  

This repo is a reflection of my **discipline + consistency** 🚴‍♂️.
